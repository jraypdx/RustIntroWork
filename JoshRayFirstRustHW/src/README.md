# Josh Ray's First Rust HW #

This rust program takes 3 arguments, and outputs the first raised to the second, modulo'd with the third.

I created this assignment from scratch with a few tips from the assignment description.  I started with no understanding of Rust.

This assignment turned out very well because it was so simple.  I believe that I have fully satisfied the requirements.

I tested my work by creating 3 example unit tests in rust which all pass correctly.  I also manually tested by using incorrect (negative) values, strings, etc.
These would cause the program to fail if incorrect variables were passed in.
